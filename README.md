# snake-client
A mini clone of the [Snek-multiplater](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek) created by taniarascia.

## Purpose

**_Published as a project for the Light House Labs project #2.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.



## Getting Started

- Follow steps inside the snek server repo to run the server side
- Run the development snake client using the `node play.js` command.
